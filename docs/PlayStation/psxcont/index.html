        <DD>
          Signal from  Controller to PSX.<BR>
          This signal is an 8 bit serial transmission synchronous to the falling edge of clock
          (That is both the incoming and outgoing signals change on a high to low transition
          of clock.  All the reading of signals is done on the leading edge to allow settling
          time.)
        </DD>
      <DT>COMMAND</DT>
        <DD>
        Signal from PSX to Controller.<BR>
        This signal is the counter part of DATA.  It is again an 8 bit serial transmission
        on the falling edge of clock.
        </DD>
      <DT>VCC</DT>
        <DD>
          VCC can vary from 5V down to 3V and the official SONY Controllers will still
          operate.  The controllers outlined here really want 5V.<BR>
          The main board in the PSX also has a surface mount
          <A HREF= "HTTP://home.quicknet.com.au/andrewm/psx/psxfuse/index.html">
          750mA fuse</A> that will blow if you try to draw to much current through the
          plug (750mA is for both left, right and memory cards).
        </DD>
      <DT>ATT</DT>
        <DD>
          ATT is used to get the attention of the controller.<BR>
          This signal will go low for the duration of a transmission.
          I have also seen this pin called Select, DTR and Command.
        </DD>
      <DT>CLOCK</DT>
        <DD>
          Signal from PSX to Controller.<BR>
          Used to keep units in sync.
        </DD>
      <DT>ACK</DT>
        <DD>
          Acknowledge signal from Controller to PSX.<BR>
          This signal should go low for at least one clock period after each 8 bits are
          sent and ATT is still held low.  If the ACK signal does not go low within
          about 60 us the PSX will then start interrogating other devices. 
        </DD>
    </DL>

    <P>
    It should also be noted that this is a bus of sorts.  This means that the wires
    are all tied together (except select which is separate for each device).  For the
    CLK, ATT, and CMD pins this does not matter as the PSX is always the originator.
    The DATA and ACK pins however can be driven from any one of four devices.  To avoid
    contentions on these lines they are open collectors and can only be driven low.
    </P>

    <A NAME="SIGNAL"><H3>The PSX Controller Signals</H3>

    All transmissions are eight bit serial LSB first. All timing in the PSX controller
    bus is synchronous to the falling edge of the clock.

    One byte of the transmissions will look kinda like this.

    ACK   ----------------------------------------------------------__-
    </PRE>

    <p>
    The logic level on the data lines is changed by the transmitting device on the
    falling edge of clock. This is then read by the receiving device on the leading
    edge (at the points marked *) allowing time for the signal to settle.  After each
    COMMAND is received by a selected controller, that controller needs to pull ACK
    low for at least one clock tick.  If a selected controller does not ACK the
    PSX will assume that there is no controller present.
    </p>

    <P>
    When the PSX wants to read information from a controller it pulls that
    devices ATT line low and issues a start command (0x01).  The Controller
    Will then reply with its ID (0x41=Digital, 0x23=NegCon, 0x73=Analogue Red
    LED, 0x53=Analogue Green LED).  At the same time as the controller is
    sending this ID byte the PSX is transmitting 0x42 to request the data.
    Following this the COMMAND line goes idle and the controller transmits
    0x5A to say "here comes the data".
    </P>

    This would look like this for a digital controller

    ACK    --------------------__-------------------__-----------------__-
    </PRE>

    <P>
    After this command initiation process the controller then sends all its data
    bytes (in the case of a digital controller there is only two).  After the last
    byte is sent ATT will go high and the controller does not need to ACK. 
    </P>

    The data transmission for a digital controller would look like this (where 
    A0,A1,A2...B6,B7 are the data bits in the two bytes).

    <A NAME="CIRCUIT"><H3>A Circuit to Emulate a PSX Controller in 74XX Logic</H3>

    <P>
    This circuit can be set up to emulate a digital controller, an analogue controller
    (in either mode) or a NegCon.  The circuit uses six 74XX IC's to emulate a digital
    controller.  To emulate an analogue controller a further four 74XX IC's and four
    A/D converters are needed.  To emulate a NegCon you also need four A/D's and four
    extra 74XX over the digital controllers six chips.
    </P>


    <H4>How the circuit works</H4>

           BORDER = 1>
    </A>
    When ATT is pulled LOW by the PSX, inverter 4/4A will pull SH/!LD on the 74HC165's
    HIGH.  This will load the data at their serial input pins (Only two of five IC's are
    shown).  Inverter 1/4A supplies the clocking for the HC165's so that on each falling
    edge of the PSX's supplied CLK the next bit of data in the HC165's is shifted out.
    This data out is gated by the ATT signal on inverter 2/4B, this is so only the
    selected device can drive the bus.
    </P>

    <P>
    The data loaded into the HC165's is directly related to the data shown in the timing
    diagrams in the section above.  Looking back at the diagram shows the first byte as
    0xFF.  This means that A1 through to A8 would all be tied HIGH.  The next byte is the
    controller ID.  For the digital controller this is 0x41 so B1-8 are HLLLLLLHL
    respectively.  The next byte is the DATA READY command 0x5A so C1-8 are HLHLLHLH.
    The final two bytes are the button presses and should be set HIGH (through a pull up)
    when the button is not pressed or LOW if the button is pressed. (NB E8 is SER IN on
    the last HC165)
    </P>

    <P>
    The Ack signal is provided by the missing pulse detector built around inverters 1/4A,
    2/4A and 1/4B.  Diode D1 only allows inverter 1/4A to charge up C1 when CLK is low.
    When CLK goes HIGH for longer than the time set by R1/C1, inverter 2/4A will go HIGH.
    This HIGH going signal is coupled to inverter 1/4B via C2 which causes its output to
    pulse LOW.  This signal is also gated by the ATT signal (again to avoid bus contention).

        The micro controller version uses the Motorola 68HC11 (no one presented a
        compelling argument to use anything different).  The code is currently set
        up to assemble for an E2 but can be changed to run on any 52 pin version
        with EEPROM (I made sure that I didn't use interrupts or use more than

    <H4>How the circuit works</H4>

    <P>
    The circuit uses a Motorola MC68HC11 to do everything.  It reads the state
    of the sixteen N/O (normally open) switch inputs on the left.  It reads the
    values of the four analog inputs on the right.  It then sends this data
    out one of its two serial ports.
    </P>

    <P>
    The four jumpers in the circuit affect how the circuit works.  J1 at the top
    of the board is used to put the HC11 into one of two operating modes.  With
    J1 open the microcontroller is in single chip mode with it closed the micro
    is in special bootstrap mode.

    The four analog inputs in the top right hand corner of the circuit are
    designed for hooking up potentiometers.  The size of the pots is not
    critical but a 10K to 50K pot would be sensible.  The three wires for

    The nine pin connector at the bottom of the circuit goes to the playstation
    as well as being used to program the microcontroller.  Its pin assignments
    are shown below.

    Finally the LVI (low voltage inhibitor) at the bottom of the circuit is used
    to keep the HC11 in a state of RESET when there is not enough voltage to run
    it safely.  It is fairly safe to leave this out of the circuit if you can't
    get hold of one but be warned you may pop that <A HREF="psxfuse.html">fuse</A>
    if you don't include it.

    <P>
    The software is totally free and can be downloaded from the URL's below.
    However it is not Freeware.  It is a slightly different concept called
    Great-Guy-Ware.  All you have to do if you wish to use the software is
    send me an E-mail telling me I am a great guy.  This serves two main
    purposes.  One is to make me feel good and secondly it encourages me
    to finish some of the other articles I may have started in the last
    ten years.

    <P>
    The software is for the microcontroller is VERY heavily commented and should
    not need any explanation.  It can be downloaded with the PCB (in auto/easytrax
    format) here <A HREF="PSXCONT.ZIP">psxcont.zip</A> (240K).

        Also included in the ZIP file above is a program called EELOADER.EXE.  This
        is an IBM executable that can be used to download the code into the HC11.
        The first two pins on the nine pin connector are a 5V RS232 port.  This can
        be connected to any serial port on your IBM compatible PC through a MAX232
        as shown.

    The PCB shown does not have connections for RTS-CTS and DTR-DSR-CD.  These
    connections must be made manually with pieces of wire soldered to the DB25
    female plug.  These connections, that are shown in the photo, are pin four
    to pin five and pin six to pin eight to pin twenty.

    To use it connect it to a 5 volt power supply.  I used four nicad batteries which
    gives 4.8v (do not use non-rechargables, the voltage will be to high).  You also
    have to connect it to a serial port on your PC and place a jumper on J1.  Then
    type <KBD>EELOAD PSXCONT.S19 /Cx</KBD> where x is the com port the
    controller is on.  Then follow the instructions on the screen.
