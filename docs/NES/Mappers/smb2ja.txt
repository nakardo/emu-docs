Mapper info by The Mad Dumper

Thanks to Thomas Steen for some debug help.

This mapper has been assigned the number 40.  (that's 40 decimal)

The ROM is mapped in from 6000-ffff.  It is broken up into 8 8K banks.
              
Bank #0 is 0000-1fff of the ROM, bank #1 is 2000-3fff of the ROM, etc.

Reads:
6000-7fff: bank #6
8000-9fff: bank #4
a000-bfff: bank #5
c000-dfff: Selectable
e000-ffff: bank #7

Writes:
8000-9fff: Disable and reset IRQ counter
a000-bfff: Enable IRQ counter
c000-dfff: Not Used 
e000-ffff: Selects desired bank


Writes to the ROM area control the bankswitching and other features of
this cart.  When writing to the ROM area, it is disabled to prevent
bus contention.


Writing anything anywhere to 8000-9fff disables the interrupt counter and
resets it.

Writing anything anywhere to a000-bfff enables the interrupt counter. 

After 4096 M2 cycles, an IRQ is generated.  This is equivalant to about
36 scanlines.

Writing to c000-bfff is not allowed.

Writing to e000-ffff selects the desired 8K bank which is then available
for use at c000-dfff.  Only D0-D2 are used, and the bank selected here
is not known on power up.
